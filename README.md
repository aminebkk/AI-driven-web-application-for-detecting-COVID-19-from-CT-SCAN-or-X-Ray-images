The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global crisis that has affected individuals worldwide since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. This pandemic has posed significant challenges, causing numerous difficulties and thousands of fatalities. One of the main obstacles is the inability of both developed and developing nations to test all suspected COVID-19 cases due to overpopulation, limited testing facilities, and a shortage of medical professionals.
The focus of this work is to propose a technological solution for detecting COVID-19 symptoms in infected patients. The objective is to utilize machine learning and image processing techniques to analyze X-ray and CT scan images of patientâ€™s lungs and compare them with data from healthy lungs. By doing so, the system aims to detect and identify the stage or condition of an infected patient, providing a more efficient approach to diagnose COVID-19.
